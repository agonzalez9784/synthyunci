I wrote this discord bot for my friend. If you want to use it, you can. You can find the source code here. 

In order to run this, you need to have node.js installed. 
You can find it here: https://nodejs.org/en/ for Windows users.
If you're running a mac, you can do:
`brew install node` 
On linux, you can do:
`sudo apt install nodejs`
For other distributions, you can look them up.

Here are the following packages you will need to run this:
`npm install @discordjs/voice`
`npm install discord`
`npm install discord.js`
`npm install ffmpeg-static`
`npm install libsodium-wrappers`
`npm install ytdl-core`

Then to start the discord bot, you need to edit the code to put the bot login token in and you need to set the prefix yourself.

To run the bot, type this:
`node server.js`

I hope you think the bot is cool, thanks :)
